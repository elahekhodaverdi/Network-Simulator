### MACAddress Class

The `MACAddress` class represents and validates MAC addresses, providing functionality to store, convert, and validate MAC addresses. It supports initialization from both a string and a byte array.

### Fields

- **`m_address`**: stores the six bytes of the MAC address.

### Method Explanations

1. **Constructors**
    - **with array**:
        - This constructor directly initializes the `m_address` field using a 6-byte array.
    - **with QString**
        - Parses the input string if it follows the format `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` using the `isValid()` method.
        - If valid, it converts the string to its 6-byte representation. Invalid inputs result in a warning, and the address is set to all zeros.

3. **`toString()`**
   - Generates a colon-separated hexadecimal string representation of the MAC address.

4. **`isValid()`**
   - Uses a regular expression to validate the format of a MAC address string.

5. **Equality Operator (`==`)**
   - Compares each byte of the `m_address` field between two `MACAddress` objects.
