## TopologyBuilder Class

The `TopologyBuilder` class is responsible for constructing various network topologies of routers, such as **Mesh**, **Ring-Star**, and **Torus**. It generates routers with unique MAC and IP addresses, and establishes connections (ports) between them based on the selected topology type. The class automates the process of building a network topology by organizing routers, binding ports, and ensuring the correct network layout.

### Fields

- **`routersNum`**: A static variable to keep track of the number of routers created. It is incremented with each new router instance to ensure unique router IDs.

### Methods Explanation

1. **`buildTopology()`**
   - This method is the main entry point for building a topology. It accepts the number of nodes, topology type, and an AS ID to generate routers. It creates each router with a unique MAC address using `MACAddressGenerator` and assigns an IP address based on the AS ID. The routers are then added to a list and connected to the `EventsCoordinator`.
   - After creating the routers, it switches to the specified topology type (`Mesh`, `Ring-Star`, or `Torus`) and builds the network layout by invoking the appropriate internal methods.
   - The method returns a list of constructed routers (`QList<RouterPtr_t>`).

2. **`buildMeshTopology()`**
   - This method arranges the routers in a **Mesh topology**. It organizes the routers into a square grid (n x n) and binds ports between adjacent routers (right-left, up-down).
   - If the number of routers does not form a perfect square, it logs a warning.

3. **`buildRingStarTopology()`**
   - This method arranges the routers into a **Ring-Star topology**. The routers are arranged in a ring with a central router. Each router in the ring is connected to its next neighbor, and additionally, every alternate router is connected to the central router (acting as the star).
   - It checks that the number of routers is valid for a Ring-Star topology (2n + 1 routers) and logs a warning if the condition is not met.

4. **`buildTorusTopology()`**
   - This method arranges the routers in a **Torus topology**, which is an extension of the Mesh topology. It connects the routers as in a Mesh, but also connects the first and last routers in both rows and columns, creating a "wrap-around" effect.

5. **`getRouterIndexAtMesh()`**
   - This utility method calculates the index of a router in a mesh grid based on its row and column position. This is used for establishing connections between adjacent routers in the mesh.

6. **`reset()`**
   - Reset the routersNum 


### Key Functionalities:

- **Router Creation**: Each router is instantiated with a unique MAC address (generated using `MACAddressGenerator`) and an IP address (derived from the AS ID and router number).
- **Port Binding**: Routers are connected through ports. The `PortBindingManager` is responsible for binding ports between routers.
- **Topology Building**: The class can build multiple types of topologies:
   - **Mesh**: A square grid of routers.
   - **Ring-Star**: A ring of routers with a central router acting as a star.
   - **Torus**: A mesh with wrap-around connections in both rows and columns.



## DHCPServer Class

The `DHCPServer` class simulates the behavior of a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, responsible for assigning IP addresses dynamically and responding to client requests within the simulation framework.

### Fields

- **`sentOffers`:**  
  A list of client IDs for which IP offers have already been sent.

- **`sentAcks`:**  
  A list of acknowledged IP addresses already assigned to clients.

### Signals

  Emitted when a new packet is generated, along with the triggering port.

### Methods Explanations

1. **`DHCPServer` (Constructor):**  
   Initializes the server with a specified IP range.

2. **`~DHCPServer` (Destructor):**  
   Cleans up the server upon destruction.

3. **`getIP`:**  
   Returns an IP address for a given client ID based on the server's IP range.

4. **`handleDiscoveryPacket`:**  
   Processes DHCP Discovery packets. If a client ID has not yet been offered an IP, generates a DHCP Offer packet and emits it.

5. **`handleRequestPacket`:**  
   Processes DHCP Request packets. If a client has not already been acknowledged, generates a DHCP Acknowledge packet and emits it.

## RoutingProtocol Class

The `RoutingProtocol` class provides a foundational interface for implementing routing protocols in network simulations.

### Fields

## OSPF Class
